         "Current scheduling tools (that I've used) are good at showing a person's availability, but not great at actually scheduling. I'd like to create an app that does this better. The simple case is when all members need to find a common meeting time: just find a meeting time. A more difficult problem would be assigning users to different times (as I had to do when scheduling recitations...) There are other use cases I'd like to consider, so this is a mental concept that I'll give myself more time to implement.",
